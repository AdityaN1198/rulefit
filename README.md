Implementation of a rule based prediction and classification algorithm based on [the rulefit algorithm from Friedman and Popescu]](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/RuleFit.pdf)


Work in progress.


Goal is to implement the rulefit algorithm similar as described in the original paper and following the guidelines of the well designed [scikit-learn package](http://scikit-learn.org/).
